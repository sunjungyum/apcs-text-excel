# AP Computer Science - Text Excel
This program organizes data into a grid measuring 10 rows by 7 columns, with the rows being numbered 1 through 10 and the columns A through G. Each cell can hold real numbers, strings, dates, and formulas (using sums and averages). It can print the entire spreadsheet, shortening strings that are too long and evaluating formulas into a single answer. As an extra challenge, this version handles bad input, evaluates formulas using order of operations, and works with parentheses. It also has a "help" function when prompted.

Assigned as a project in the AP Computer Science A curriculum.
